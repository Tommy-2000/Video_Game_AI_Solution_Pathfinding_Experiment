# Video Game AI Pathfinding Experiment - Q-Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning using Stable Baselines 3 and A* Search - Artificial Intelligence Foundations - MSc. Computer Science - September 2022/January 2023

This experiment was developed as a means of finding the most effective method of video game pathfinding between three different (informed search) methods. The methods used consisted of Q-Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning using Stable Baselines 3 and A Star Search. All three methods were written and tested within a Google Colab environment in Python. Each method is also written in separate Python files alongside the main Jupyter Notebook file to allow for local testing if you wish.


## Important!

It is recommended to test run the Jupyter Notebook file in a Google Colab environment before testing and optimising performance on your own local machine.
